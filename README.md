## Overview
The ``filepattern`` utility is used to store files that follow a pattern, where the pattern is analogous to a simplified regular expression. The need for 
``filepattern`` arises in situations where large amounts of data with a systematic naming convention needs to be filtered by patterns in the naming. For example, one may have
a directory containing segmented images where the name contains information such as the channel, the column value, and the row value. ``filepatern`` provides the ability to 
extract all images containing such a naming pattern, filter by the row or column value, or group files by one of the affermentioned variables.

## StringPattern
StringPattern contains all the functionalility of FilePattern, except it takes in a txt file as an input rather than a directory.
  
## ExternalFilePattern
ExternalFilePattern has the same functionality as FilePattern, however it processes the input in a specified block size for when the input is too large to store in main memory, or for when the memory use of FilePattern must be restricted.
